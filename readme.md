# Python Script Collection

## Introduction
This repository is an archive of Python scripts I have created for personal productivity and utility. These scripts are shared in the spirit of collaboration and improvement.

This is an ongoing project, once I write a script I'll add more.

## Contents
The scripts encompass a range of functions primarily focused on email processing and storage management. Each script is self-contained and addresses a specific task.

## Usage
To utilize the scripts, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Clone the repository to your local machine, navigate to the desired script, and execute it with Python from your command line interface.

## Dependencies
The scripts are developed with Python 3.x. They may require additional libraries, which can be installed via `pip`.

## Contribution
Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you have enhancements or new utility scripts that you would like to share, please submit a pull request.

## Support
For questions or support regarding the scripts, please open an issue in the repository, and I will address it as promptly as possible.

## Acknowledgements
I appreciate the use of open-source resources that have made this collection possible and hope to contribute back to the community with these utilities.
